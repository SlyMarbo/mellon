"Speak, friend, and enter."

Mellon provides the core functionality for password management and generation.
It's still under development and hasn't seen any outside cryptographic analysis,
so I wouldn't recommend using it for any particularly sensitive data, but it does
work.

mellon will be used internally by an up-coming Android app for managing/generating
passwords.
